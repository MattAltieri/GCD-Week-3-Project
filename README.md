## Variable ("feature") names
In the source data, variable names do not follow a consistent format or use clear abbreviations. In our dataset, we will be following the pattern below for all numeric measures. ("[somethingsomething] indicates optional.)

```
[domain.]device.source.calculation.direction
```
 
**Definitions for each portion are provided below:**
- Domain
	- Time
		- In features.txt from the source data: `t`
			- e.g. "tBodyAccMag-mean()", "tGravityAccMag-max()", etc.
		- In our dataset: **no symbol**  
			- e.g. "accel.body.mean.magnitude", "accel.grav.max.magnitude", etc.
			- The domain is assumed to be time unless otherwise specified, as these are the measurements from the actual devices. Additionally, `time` is an ambiguous term that could lead the analyst to believe we were describing units rather than domain
	- Frequency (via FFT transform of some Time Domain measurements)
		- In features.txt from the source data: `f`
			- e.g. "fBodyAccMag-mean()", "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z", etc.
			- features_info.txt does not specify which FFT algorithm was used
		- In our dataset:`fft`
			- e.g. "fft.accel.body.mean.magnitude", "fft.accelJerk.body.std.Z", etc.
			- The frequency domain is _derived_ via Fast Fourier transforms of values from the time domain, so we _derive_ the frequency domain names by modifying the time domain measurements with the `fft` prefix.
				- `freq` was considered as a possible prefix, but as some measurements in the source use `freq` to mean something slightly different, and I wanted the meaning to be unambiguous.
- Device
	- Accelerometer
		- In features.txt from the source data: `Acc`
			- e.g. "tGravityAccMag-mean(), "tGravityAccMag-arCoeff()1", etc.
		- In our dataset: `accel`
			- e.g. "accel.grav.mean.magnitude", "accel.grav.autoReg1.magnitude", etc.
			- `accel` was chosen over `acc` in an effort to reduce ambiguity
	- Gyroscope
		- In features.txt from the source data: `Gyro`
			- e.g. "tBodyGyroMag-mean()", "tBodyGyroMag-std()", etc.
		- In our dataset: `gyro`
			- e.g. "gyro.body.mean.magnitude", "gyro.body.std.magnitude", etc.
- Signal Source
	- Body
		- In features.txt from the source data: `Body` or `BodyBody` 
			- e.g. "tBodyAccMag-mean()", "fBodyBodyGyroMag-max()", etc.
			- `BodyBody` appears to be a typo in source data, but it is consistently applied. There is no modifier of `BodyBody` indicated in features_info.txt, so it is assumed to mean the same thing as `Body`
		- In our dataset: `body`
			- e.g. "accel.body.mean.magnitude", "fft.gyro.body.max.magnitude", etc.
	- Body Jerk
		- In features.txt from the source data: `Body...Jerk` or `BodyBody...Jerk`
			- e.g. "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()", "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-max()", etc 
			- `BodyBody` appears to be a typo in source data, but it is consistently applied. There is no modifier of `BodyBody` indicated in features_info.txt, so it is assumed to mean the same thing as `Body`
		- In our dataset: `bodyJerk`
			- e.g. "accel.bodyJerk.mean.magnitude", "fft.gyro.bodyJerk.max.magnitude", etc.
			- `bodyJerk` is used instead of `body.jerk` to help indicate that this is derived from the `body` signals, and to keep variable names w/i the form `[domain.]device.source.calculation.direction`
	- Gravity
		- In features.txt from the source data: `Gravity`
			- e.g. "tGravityAccMag-mean(), "tGravityAccMag-arCoeff()1", etc.
		- In our dataset: `grav`
			- e.g. "accel.grav.mean.magnitude", "accel.grav.autoReg1.magnitude", etc.
- Calculation
	- Note: the source data captures a variety of calculations, but for this dataset we are only concerned with two; the mean and the standard deviation.
	- Let it be understood that "meanFreq" from the source data is not precisely the same thing as "mean" in terms of signal measurement. Since the request specified only "mean" and "standard deviation", "meanFreq" is being excluded.
	- The "angle" calculations are also excluded, even when operating on the mean, for the same reason.
	- Mean
		- In features.txt from the source data: `-mean()` 
			- e.g. "tBodyAccMag-mean()", "tGravityAccMag-mean()", etc.
		- In our dataset: `mean`
			- e.g. "accel.body.mean.magnitude", "accel.grav.mean.magnitude", etc.
	- Standard Deviation
		- In features.txt from the source data: `-std()`
			- e.g. "tBodyAccMag-std()", "tGravityAccMag-std()", etc.
		- In our dataset: `std`
			- e.g. "accel.body.std.magnitude", "accel.grav.std.magnitude", etc.
	- The following source calculations are being excluded from our dataset:
		- mad(): Median absolute deviation 
		- max(): Largest value in array
		- min(): Smallest value in array
		- sma(): Signal magnitude area
		- energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
		- iqr(): Interquartile range 
		- entropy(): Signal entropy
		- arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
		- correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
		- maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
		- meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
		- skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
		- kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
		- bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
		- angle(): Angle between to vectors.
- Direction of motion
	- X
		- In features.txt from the source data: `-X`
			- e.g. "tBodyAcc-mean()-X", "tBodyAcc-std()-X", etc.
		- In our dataset: `x`
			- e.g. "accel.body.mean.x", "accel.body.std.x", etc.
	- Y
		- In features.txt from the source data: `-Y`
			- e.g. "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y", "tBodyAcc-std()-Y", etc.
		- In our dataset: `x`
			- e.g. "accel.body.mean.y", "accel.body.std.y", etc. 
	- Z
		- In features.txt from the source data: `-Z`
			- e.g. "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z", "tBodyAcc-std()-Z", etc.
		- In our dataset: `x`
			- e.g. "accel.body.mean.z", "accel.body.std.z", etc.
	- Magnitude
		- In features.txt from the source data: `Mag`
			- e.g. "tBodyAccMag-mean()", "tBodyAccMag-std()", etc
		- In our dataset: `magnitude`
			- e.g. "accel.body.mean.magnitude", "accel.body.std.magnitude", etc.
		- `mag` was considered as an option, but ultimately rejected in order to reduce ambiguity
